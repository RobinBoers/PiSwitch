# The PiSwitch boot screen as a standalone program

I'm making the PiSwitch boot screen into a standalone repo. I'm doing this mainly for personal use.

NewTouchBoot is a folder that gets put under `/opt/retropie/configs/all/`
It contains a bunch of scripts and a python program that launches a touch boot option menu.
